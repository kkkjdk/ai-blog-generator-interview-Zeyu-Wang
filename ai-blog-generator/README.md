- The scheduler is set to run **daily at 00:00 (midnight) EST** by default.  
- To customize the schedule, modify the `scheduler.add_job()` line in `app.py`:

  scheduler.add_job(
      id='scheduled_blog_post',
      func=scheduled_job,
      trigger='cron',
      hour=0,  # Change this to adjust the hour (24-hour format)
      minute=0  # Change this to adjust the minute
  )
  ```

  - Example: Set `hour=6` to run at 6 AM EST daily.
